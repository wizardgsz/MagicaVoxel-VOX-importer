# MagicaVoxel-VOX-importer
Blender import add-on for [MagicaVoxel `.vox` format](https://github.com/ephtracy/voxel-model/blob/master/MagicaVoxel-file-format-vox.txt).

MagicaVoxel and other voxel editing software are great to quickly create voxel models, though it's not always desirable to stay within that ecosystem. This add-on imports each voxel of the original model as an individual cube primitive. This opens up the use of voxel models for projects such as physics simulations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

This add-on needs to be installed into Blender in order to be used.
Directions for this process can be found [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#rd-party-add-ons) directly from the Blender Documentation.

Only [`io_scene_vox.py`](io_scene_vox.py) need be installed, other files in this repository are not functionally required.

**Note:** in order to enable the add-on, you will need to have `Testing` add-ons visible within the Blender Preferences menu.

### Usage

With the add-on installed and enabled, the importer can be accessed from `File > Import > MagicaVoxel (.vox)`

**Note**: currently this add-on does not support all the features of `.vox` files created with MagicaVoxel 0.99 and above. If this is the version of MagicaVoxel you are using, you will need to export your file to the older 0.98 format before import.

**This export is destructive**, it will remove layer information and other features that were added in 0.99. It is therefore recommended you export as a separate filename so as to not lose work.

### Import options

This add-on offers several import options, seen on the file select menu of the import.

![Import Options](https://i.imgur.com/Syyxs8E.png)

- *Voxel Spacing*: controls distance center to center of neighbouring voxels.
- *Voxel Size*: how large each voxel should be, in Blender Units.
- *Animation frame to load*: for `.vox` files that contain animation frames, only 1 frame may be imported at a time, this option selects that value. If a value is given that exceeds the final frame, the final frame is used instead.
- *Use Voxel Bounds*: import only a sub-set of the model, potentially useful for loading larger models.
  - *Start Voxel* / *End Voxel*: define which voxels to import.
- *Use Palette Colors*: should the colors present in the `.vox` file be imported as materials?
- *Gamma Correct Colors*: in order to reproduce colors in the render, colors in the palette are gamma corrected. Disabling this will likely cause discoloration compared to the model when viewed in MagicaVoxel.
  - *Gamma Correction Value*: value of color correction, default of 2.2, see [here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/color_management.html) for more information.
- *Use Shadeless Materials*: makes materials 'shadeless' by changing the material type to emissive.
- *Join Voxels*: currently na√Øve option to perform a join operation on the voxels after import. This will make manipulating the model much more performant, though is not suitable in all cases, i.e. physics simulations.
